   This is the KookaBlockly display with the controls labelled. 

The application window has numerous controls, as are described below:

Version
-------

The version of KookaBlockly is shown at the top-left of the KookaBlockly window.

Resize / Exit
-------------

These controls allow the KookaBlockly window to be minimises or maximised, and the KookBlockly application to be exited.

If the KookBlockly script has not been saved before attempting to exit KookaBlockly, a prompt dialogue will appear providing an opportunity to save or not save the current script to a file.

Resizing of the window can also be accomplished by clicking on the window edges and dragging to resize.

The appearance and location of these controls varies between Windows, MacOS and Raspbian and conforms to the conventions used by the user interface of those operating systems. 

Workspace
---------

In the centre of the window is the KookaBlockly workspace.  Blocks can be dragged into this space, repositioned, resized and deleted by using the mouse or trackpad.

Blocks Palette
--------------

Down the left of the window is a vertically-oriented list of the KookaBlockly pallete categories. 

Click on any category to reveal the pallete of blocks, click on and drag the desired block to the workspace, position it and release to drop the block in place.
