Strings
=======



Strings are an array of consecutive text characters such as “Hello”, or “this is a string”.
The Strings Category provides a set of value blocks for specifying and formatting strings.

 


Text
----

 

This block allows a user to type in text that can be used as a value by other blocks.


Format as Integer and width
---------------------------

 

This block takes a numerical value block and formats its result as an integer with a width as defined in the block.  For example, the integer 1000 would be formatted as the character string “1000”.



Format Number as Floating Point
-------------------------------


 

This block takes a numerical value block and formats its result as a floating point number with 
the specified number of decimal places and width not including the decimal point.  For the 
above example, the number 123.4567 would result in the character string “123.46”.  Note that 
the last digit is rounded up if greater than or equal to 5 or down if less than 5.
