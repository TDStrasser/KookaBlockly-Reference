The **LEDs** category, shown in :numref:`ledpalette`, supports the three LED’s that are beneath the display on the **Kookaberry**. 

These **LEDs** are coloured ``red``, ``orange`` and ``green``.

In addition, support is provided for NeoPixel RGB **LEDs**.

Toggle means to change the state of the LED from ``OFF`` to ``ON``, or from ``ON`` to ``OFF``, depending on the LED’s state. 

Set NeoPixel
------------

This block supports NeoPixel arrays connected to one of the connections selected in the drop- 
down box.

Neopixels are multicolour **LEDs** with Red, Green and Blue **LEDs** in every individual Neopixel.  The 
apparent colour of a Neopixel is the result of mixing the Red Green and Blue colours, in the same 
way that a television screen produces colours.

Neopixels come as single units or in chains of multiple Neopixels.

The following are the controls that can be set or manipulated on this block:

Pin
    The **Kookaberry** has five connectors on the back, ``P1`` through to ``P5``, with connector ``P3`` having 
    two possible connection points: ``P3A`` and ``P3B``. (see the :doc:`pins` category description).
    
    It is possible to replace the **Pins** dropdown selection block with a **String** block.   
    This is useful when using **Pins** other than those exposed on the rear of the **Kookaberry**, 
    or when other microprocessor boards that are compatible with **Kookaberry** firmware are being used.
    In those cases type in the Pin's identifier into the **String** block.
  

pixel
    This is an integer commencing at ``0`` which specifies which pixel in the array will be set.

.. important:: 
    The **Kookaberry** can only supply a limited amount of current power to a NeoPixel array.  
    It is recommended to use no more than 8 NeoPixels, and also to limit the brightness of each to no more than ``50`` when using more than 4 NeoPixels.

    If more NeoPixels and/or brighter illumination is required, then a special power adapter between the **Kookaberry** and the NeoPixel array is recommended.

RGB values
    Each of the R (red), G (green) and B (blue) values can be set with integers in the range ``0`` to ``100`` inclusive.

    By varying the ratio of RGB values set, a wide range of colours can be achieved, as shown in :numref:`ledrgbvenn`.
