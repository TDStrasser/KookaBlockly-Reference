    Kookaberry
      The Kookaberry is a microcomputer specifically designed for STEM educational applications.      
    Visual Code Editor
      A visual code editor allows users to work with code visually but still involves actual code blocks or snippets. 
      It might use drag-and-drop interfaces, code blocks, or other visual elements to assist in code creation.
      Visual code editors often aim to make coding more accessible to beginners or those who are not familiar with traditional text-based coding environments.
      It differs from a graphical code editor that may involve more abstract graphical representations of code structures, while
      visual code editors usually retain a connection to the actual code, using visual elements to enhance the coding experience.
