Maths

Fundamental to any computer program is the ability to execute mathematical computations.  
The Math Category provides the repertoire of mathematical functions.

 


Number
------

 

This value block represents a fixed number that is specified, in this case 123.  The number can be 
edited.



Arithmetic
----------

 

This value block operates on two value blocks that represent numbers with the chosen 
arithmetic operator.  Operations are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (x), division (÷) 
and raised to the power of (^).

Multiply and Add Functions
--------------------------

 

This value block multiplies the first numerical value block by the second numerical value block 
and then adds the third numerical value block.


Scale Function
--------------

Math Functions
--------------


This value block performs the chosen mathematical function on the socketed numerical value 
block.  The options that are available are square root, absolute value, negation, natural 
logarithm, base 10 logarithm, e^, and 10^.



Trigonometric Functions
-----------------------


This value block performs the basic selected trigonometric functions on the socketed numerical 
value block.  It also has the inverse of the basic trigonometric functions.












Special Constants
-----------------


This value block has several special numbers to choose from including pi(π) used in dealing with 
circles; e , a mathematical constant; phi(ϕ) being the golden ratio; the square root of 2; the 
square root of ½ and infinity (∞).



Number Property Test
--------------------












This value block gives a True or False value depending on whether the socketed numerical value 
block has the chosen property or not.  Properties to test include:  even, odd, prime, whole, 
positive, negative and divisible by.  If ‘divisible by’ is selected it will add a second socket for the 
number to test against.









Round Number
------------



This value block rounds the socketed numerical value block with the chosen method.  Round 
rounds the number in the standard manner, ie 0.5 rounds up and below 0.5 rounds down. 
Round Up always rounds up if there is any fraction and Rounds Down removes any fractional component.




Random Fraction
---------------

 

This value block creates a random number from 0 up to but not including 1




Atan2 of X
----------

 

This value block returns the arc tangent of two numerical value blocks x and y .  It is similar to 
calculating the arc tangent of y/x, except that the signs of both arguments are used to determine 
the quadrant of the result.  The result is an angle expressed in radians.
