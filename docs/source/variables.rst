Variables
=========




Variables are a way of creating and manipulating a named numerical value, in the same way that 
algebra uses names to refer to a numerical value.  Examples of typical variable names are X, Y 
and Z referring to cartesian coordinates; H, W and D as dimensions of an object; 
and I as an index into a list.
