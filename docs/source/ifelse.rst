If – Else
=========



The If-Else category comprises control blocks which direct the flow of a program depending on the results of the tests carried out by these blocks.

 




If…Do
-----


 

The conditional socket takes a value block or compound block that represents a True or False value.  If the value block in the conditional socket is True, it runs the blocks nested inside.  If the block in the conditional socket is False, it skips the nested blocks.



 

The If…Do block is configurable.    -   By clicking the gear icon on the block, extra elections can be added.  Else..If sections add more conditional sockets to check if the previous conditional sockets are False.  IF ANY CONDITIONAL SOCKET IS True, it will run the blocks nested under it then skip past any future test.  If all conditional socket tests as false, it will run the blocks under the Else header, if there is one.
