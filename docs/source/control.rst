Control
-------

The **Control** blocks in :numref:`contpalette` direct program flow or provide time-related functionality.

   The palette of **KookaBlockly** **Control** blocks


Each block is described in turn below.

On Start
--------

The "on start" block is intended to contain other action blocks that will run first and only once when the **KookaBlockly** script starts.

Typically the blocks contained are for the initialisation of the display, variables, sensors, and actuators.


Scheduled Loop
--------------

This block is a loop that repeatedly runs the blocks nested inside at the time interval specified in the numeric box.

   :alt: Timed Loop Block


The loop will continue forever at the defined period unless the program is externally stopped.

The time specification is a number in decimal seconds, for example: 1 is 1 second, and 0.001 is 1 millisecond.


Every Loop
----------

This block runs the blocks nested inside in a repeated loop.

   :alt: Every Loop Block


The loop will run forever unless externally stopped by exiting the script, or resetting the **Kookaberry** or removing power from the **Kookaberry**.  

Another name for this block is the Repeat Forever loop.

Exit Program
------------

This block directs the running program to exit.

Sleep
-----
 
This block causes the program to wait / pause for the specified time before continuing to the next block.

   :alt: Timed Sleep Block


The number in the box specifies the duration of sleep in decimal seconds.

Time (s)
--------

This block returns a value in whole seconds since the **Kookaberry’s** epoch time ( 00:00:00 on 1st 
January 2000).

By subtracting successive values given by this block, the elapsed interval in 
seconds between the samples may be calculated which is useful for timing functions.

.. note:: 

   **epoch time** is the point from which time is measured.  This point differs for different operating systems.  
   For MicroPython on micro-computers, the **epoch time** is 2000-01-01 00:00:00.

   **epoch time** should not be confused with the **default time** set on the **Kookaberry**'s internal Real Time Clock (**RTC**), which is 2015-01-01 00:00:00.
   Using **KookaBlockly**, however, the **Kookaberry**'s internal **RTC** will be synchronised with the time on the PC it is tethered to using its USB connection.


Time (ms)
---------

This block returns a value in milliseconds since the **Kookaberry’s** epoch time (00:00:00 on 1st 
January 2000).

   :alt: Time Miiliseconds Value Block


By subtracting successive values given by this block, the elapsed interval in 
milliseconds between the samples may be calculated which is useful for high-resolution timing functions.
