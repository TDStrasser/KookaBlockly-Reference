Each block in the **Buttons** category is described in turn below.

When Button Was Pressed
-----------------------

This is a control loop that performs the actions contained within it whenever the selected 
button *was pressed*.

   :alt: When Button Was Pressed Block

The button options are ``A``, ``B``, ``C``, or ``D``.  

*was pressed* means that the actions within the loop will be performed only once after the selected button press.


When Button Is Pressed
----------------------

This is a control loop that performs the actions contained within it as long as the selected 
button *is pressed*.

The button options are ``A``, ``B``, ``C``, or ``D``.  

*is pressed* means that the actions will be performed repeatedly as long as the selected button is being pressed.

Button was pressed
------------------

This is a value block whose result is ``True`` (= ``1``) whenever the selected button was pressed.

The button options are ``A``, ``B``, ``C``, or ``D``.

After this value block is used its output reverts to ``False`` (= ``0``) until the next time the button was pressed.

The button options are ``A``, ``B``, ``C``, or ``D``.

Th output of this value block reverts to ``False`` (= ``0``) when the button is not being pressed.


Button to Exit Program
----------------------

This is a combination of two blocks: the **button was pressed** control loop, as described above, and the **exit program** action.

The result of using this combination is whenever the button selected was pressed the currently running program will finish.
