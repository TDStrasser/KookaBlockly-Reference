KookaBlockly Reference Manual Examples
======================================

This collection contains the **KookaBlockly** scripts used in the **KookaBlockly** Reference Guide.

To use them, download them from this site and store them in your Kookaberry Scripts / KookaBlockly folder (or a sub-folder).
Load the script using the **KookaBlockly** editor and with a **Kookaberry** tethered via USB, click on Run.

These scripts here are still under development and not yet stable enough for general public release.
