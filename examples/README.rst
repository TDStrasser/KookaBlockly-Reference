KookaBlockly Reference Manual Examples
======================================

This collection contains the **KookaBlockly** scripts used in the **KookaBlockly** Reference Guide.

To use them, download them from this site and store them in your Kookaberry Scripts / KookaBlockly folder (or a sub-folder).
Load the script using the **KookaBlockly** editor and with a **Kookaberry** tethered via USB, click on Run.

There are also a couple of games written using KookaBlockly - 

* Sprites - two sprites, one running across the display, another dropping.  
  Steer the dropping sprite with the C and D buttons to hit the other sprite and score a point.
* Tilt_n_Draw - hold the Kookaberry level and while pressing the C button tilt it to draw pixels on the display.  
  Press D to use an eraser, and B to clear the display.
